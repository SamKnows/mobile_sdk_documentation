# Introduction

Welcome to the SamKnows Mobile SDK Reference Guide

The SamKnows Mobile SDK and its Kit frameworks allow you to leverage the SamKnows suite of tests within your own app with minimal setup. You can select from any of the currently supported tests. Along with the test-specific metrics, we also collect various environmental and connection metrics and submit this to the SamKnows One platform, along with your panel key, ensuring availability of your data. It is also possible to specify another URL to submit the metrics to and this can be set via the SKDMetrics object. Please see the API documentation for specifics on this.
